# Player Re-Identification in Sports Footage

## Overview
This project implements player re-identification for sports footage using YOLOv11 object detection and custom tracking algorithms.

## Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8+
- pip

### Installation
1. Clone this repository
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt

## File Structure
1. main.py - Orchestrates the entire pipeline: reads video, detects and tracks players, and saves output.
2. player_detector.py - Uses a YOLO model to detect players in indivisual frames.
3. player_tracker.py - maintaines player identity over time by tracking centroids with custom logic.

## Features 
1. Player Detection:
    Uses Yolo given model to detect players in each frame.
2. Player Tracking:
    A custom object tracker maintains player dentities frame-by-frame by comparing centroid distances.
3. Video Processing:
    Reads input video, overlays bounding boxes and player IDs AND outputs an anootated video with JSON tracking data.
4. Output Generation:
    Annotated video(outputs/output_video.mp4)
    JSON tracking file (outputs/tracking_results.json) with player IDs, bouding boxes, confidence frame number.

## Performance & usage
* Model Used: YOLO (you can plug in any .pt model compatible with ultralytics)
* Tracking Speed: Real-time processing on standard video resolution (720p tested)
* Accurate ID Re-association: Based on proimity of player centroids (distance threshold = 80 pixesl)
* Supports Video Input via CLI:
* python main.py --video path/to/video.mp4 --model path/to/model.pt

## Limitations 
* Logic:- Used Euclidean distance for centroid matching is failed with overlapping players or occlusions.
* Player Class Assumption: model assign class 0 for players. any differet labelling will cause detection failure unless modified in player_detector.py
* No Motion or Appearance Modeling: Unlike advanced trackers like DeepSORT, this implementation doesn't incorporate appearance embeddings or Kalman filters.
* Hardcoded Output paths: Output files (outputs/output_video.mp4, outputs/tracking_results.json) are fixed unless changed via CLI or code.

## üîÆ Future Improvements
* ‚úÖ Integrate a more sophisticated multi-object tracking system (e.g., DeepSORT or BYTETrack)
* ‚úÖ Add support for tracking lost and reappeared players using re-identification features.
* ‚úÖ Visualize player movement paths and heatmaps for sports analytics.
* ‚úÖ Make output directories configurable and improve CLI usability.
* ‚úÖ Add performance benchmarks (FPS, accuracy metrics).
* ‚úÖ Support multi-class tracking (e.g., players, ball, referees).

This project implements **multi-stage player tracking** and re-identification in sports videos using YOLO-based detection and custom tracking logic. It supports increasing levels of tracking sophistication, from simple centroid matching to advanced persistent re-identification with object memory and trajectory analysis.

## üöß Limitations

- All models assume YOLO class `0` is a **player**.
- Lighting or motion blur can impact detection confidence.
- **No deep appearance re-ID** (no ResNet/Siamese embedding).
- Uses custom logic instead of Hungarian algorithm for assignment.
- Not optimized for real-time on CPU for large inputs.

## üîÆ Future Improvements

- Integrate DeepSORT or BoT-SORT for hybrid tracking
- Train custom re-ID model for appearance features
- Replace centroid distance with cosine similarity on embeddings
- Use Kalman Filter for motion prediction
- GUI dashboard to visualize player stats and heatmaps
- Allow ball detection and separation
